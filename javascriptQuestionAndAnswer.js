   In your own words, explain what a javascript ‘class’ is and how it differs from a function.

        ans: javascript 'class' is the keyword for creating classes in javascript which gives room for object oriented programming.
             the main difference between class and functions is that functions are methods within a class, and a class can have methods
             and properties that can be inherited while functions don't have such bahviours.
